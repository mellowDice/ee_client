# ShatterLand Client

Free iOS VR game where marble players compete with each other for dominance.


## Game Play

 * Larger players bust smaller players by running into them
 * Players grow by eating fragments scattered on the field
 * Obstacles (large purple spike balls) shoot players into the sky and reduce mass for larger players

## Primary Server and Movement Service
### Overview

Server's primary responsibility is to relay data between clients and pull data from other services in the network. On initial connection if terrain has not yet been saved in memory, server requests terrain from Landscape service and sends to the client. The server pulls all players and objects from the database and relays them to the new client. 

During gameplay, the server listens for player updates and sends data to the client. The client determines player physics and sends that to the server. The server is responsible for increasing and decreasing player mass on collisions between players and game objects like food and obstacles. 

The server relies on Redis to track all clients connected to the game as well as the zombie players that are spawned and 'owned' by all the connected clients.

## Landscape Service

A fractal mesh-generation implementation using a matrix-based Perlin noise algroithm.

#### Fractal Landscape Generator
The landscape is generated by layering 2D noise of different scales
![Fractal Landscape Diagram](https://github.com/mellowDice/ee_diagrams/blob/master/Fractal%20Noise%20Diagram.jpg?raw=true)
##### Inputs
Octaves: Number of layers to use (maximum may be limited by size of grid); lower octaves are rolling hills; higher octaves are localized bumpiness.

Amplitude Scaling: Each octave's amplitude is scaled by 0.6^(octave no), so lower octaves.

Period Scaling: Each octave's period is (1/1.8)x smaller than the previous octave's period. An octave's period represents the areal width or height of each "bump"


#### Matrix-based 2D Noise Generator
Generates a Perlin-Like 2D Noise for input into the fractal landscape generator. This uses a grid of random unit vectors (coarse grid), which point toward desired downslopes.

![2D Noise Generator Diagram](https://github.com/mellowDice/ee_diagrams/blob/master/2D%20Noise%20Diagram.jpg?raw=true)
*Diagram: Arrows point in direction of downslopes*


The height (y-axis) of all the points on the map (fine grid) are interpolations of the grid definition provided by the coarse grid.


![Height Interpoliation Diagram](https://github.com/mellowDice/ee_diagrams/blob/master/2D%20Noise%20Diagram%20-%20Interpolations.jpg?raw=true)
*Diagram: The dark dot is a high point because all coarse grid vectors point away from it*

At any given point of the fine grid, a vector is drawn to each coarse-grid point (arrow vectors). The calculated height is the weighted average of all the dot-products (*coarse-grid unit vectors* dot *arrow vectors*)

This noise generator uses matrix math to calculate the height of each point. There are three matricies, which are all multiplied to generate the final height map:

##### Coarse Grid Vectors (5-dimensions)
The coarse grid is first calculated using random unit vectors. Then it is tiled out in the following format

```

First 2 Dimensions represent the X and Z coordinates of the height map

Next 2 Dimensions hold the four coarse grid vectors important to any given point of the height map
[[upper-left vector, upper-right vector],
 [lower-left vector, lower-right vector]]
 
Final Dimension represents the unit vector of each point
[unit vector X, unit vector Z]

```

##### Arrow Vectors (5-dimensions)
These are arrows to each corner

```

First 2 Dimensions represent the X and Z coordinates of the height map

Next 2 Dimensions are hold the arrows which point to each of the four coarse-grid corners
[[arrow to upper-left corner, arrow to upper-right corner],
 [arrow to lower-left corner, arrow to lower-right corner]]
 
Final Dimension represents the unit vector of each point
[vector X, vector Z]

```


##### Weighting Vector (5-dimensions)
These are the weights of each coarse grid and arrow grid multiplication.

Normalized horizontal distance from corner * Normalied vertical distance from corner

```

First 2 Dimensions represent the X and Z coordinates of the height map

Next 2 Dimensions are hold the arrows which point to each of the four coarse-grid corners
[[weight for upper-left corner dot-product, weight for upper-right corner dot-product],
 [weight for lower-left corner dot-product, weight for lower-right corner dot-product]]
 
Final Dimension has the same weight in both indexes
[weight, same weight]

```

##### Solving the height map
1) The three vectors are multiplied.

2) To complete the dot-product both indexes of the final-dimension (vector-X, vector-Z) are summed

3) The weighted dot products are summed (dimensions 3, 4) to create the weighted dot product and final height map
